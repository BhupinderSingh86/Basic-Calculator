# Basic Calculator

This is my first ever project after learning some basics of Vanilla JavaScript, which I started learning some weeks ago. I wanted to get to grips with some basic JavaScript operations and understading the relationship between the Brower,DOM, HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

# Main Learning Points:
-	how to structure a project
-	how HTML elements works / The releationship between the DOM, CSS & JavaScript
-	Using JavaScript to make elements interactive
-	Understanding how to work functions with blocks of code
-	how to create and implement event listerners to this project
-	Using if statements with operators
-	Creating a link to CSS and JavaScript within HTML

I'm sure there are lots of improvements that could be made but it's a start!
